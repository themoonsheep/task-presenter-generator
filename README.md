# Task Presenter Generator
A script that looks at a data model repository and generates its task presenter for Moonsheep.

## Initial Idea

### Use Case 1:
**Input:** URL of data model GitHub repository

**Output:** Generated task presenter as an HTML file.

### Use Case 2:

**Inputs:**
	
- URL of data model GitHub repository.
- Moonsheep database connection details.
- Project slug.

**Output:** SQL insert of generated task presenter HTML in Moonsheep database.
